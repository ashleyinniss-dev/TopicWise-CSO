# TopicWise-CSO
Problem Addressed:

Many Caribbean secondary students struggle to find organized digital study materials tailored to their subjects and exam schedules. Past papers, study guides, and practice questions are often scattered across the web or hard to access (behind a paywall), making exam preparation stressful. TopicWise addresses this by providing a single platform where students can plan, practice, and track their studies.

Project Overview & Features

TopicWise is a web-based platform that allows students to select their subjects, browse topics, and practice exam-style questions. 
Features include:
	•	Personalized Subject Selection: Students choose the subjects they are writing.
	•	Topic Selection: Students browse and practice topics for each subject.
	•	Progress Tracking: Track completed topics and focus on weaker areas.
	•	Mock Exam Mode: Simulate timed exams with past paper questions.
	•	Exam Countdown: Shows the number of days until each exam.
	•	Resources: Access past papers, flashcards, study guides, sba samples, revision notes etc.

Technologies Used
	•	Languages & Frameworks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (Flask)
	•	AI Tools: Only used minimally for troubleshooting and organization; the website structure and code were written manually over the course of 80 hours, and all content was researched and compiled by us.

Approach & Potential

The platform organizes scattered study materials and makes exam preparation interactive and efficient. It is relevant to the Caribbean region as it focuses on CSEC exams, CSEC students and CSEC materials. TopicWise is innovative, practical, and scalable, with potential for wider use across other Caribbean schools.
